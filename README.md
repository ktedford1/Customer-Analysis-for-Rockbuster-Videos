## Description

The goal of this project was to assist the fictional online video rental company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, by answering business questions about the location of their customer base and their preferences.

## Objectives

Rockbuster is preparing to launch an online video service. To develop their strategy, they’ve asked for insights into which movies, countries and customers have contributed the most to sales or that have the potential to drive increased future sales and revenue.

## Data

The Rockbuster database comprises 15 tables, including 2 fact tables and 13 dimension tables, covering payments, rentals, customers, stores, staff, and movie inventory.

## Recommendations

After analyzing the database using PostgreSQL, we prepared a report containing visualizations made with Tableau to illustrate our findings and lay the groundwork for our recommendations. The report file is available here as “Rockbuster Analysis Presentation.pdf"

## Languages and Technologies

For this project, I used PostgreSQL to query the Rockbuster Video database and Tableau to visualize the results.
